# [[agora bot]] for Matrix
A simple [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) that responds to [[wikilinks]] resolved to an [[agora]] (or [[commons]]).

## Usage
'[[foo]]' responds with https://anagora.org/foo by default; override Agora if you want to resolve elsewhere.

## Deploying

I use `mbc build` followed by `mbc upload`.

`mbc auth` will be needed the first time.
